### Description

- The app we created is to streamline the quote process for custom apparel. Theoretically this layout could work for any business that needs input from the user or client inorder to begin their process of businss. In this case we are creating a inquiry form for custom apparel. The app allows a user to sign up and then fill out and submit a form in order to recieve an accurate quote from the custom apparel company. The admins would be able to access the backend data and email back each potentially customer with a detailed quote based on the information entered.

### Tech Used:

- React.js
- Express.js
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Bootstrap

### MVP

- User will be able to fill out a form and submit it

### Stretch Goals

- Google Authentication

- Admins will have a log in portal to view submissions
- Email will be sent to owners of each individual inquiry
- Have an instagram feed on the home page
